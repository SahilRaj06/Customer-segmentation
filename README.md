# 🧩 Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning

This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to segment customers based on their purchasing behaviour and demographic data. The goal is to help businesses understand their customer base and tailor marketing strategies for each segment.

---

## 📊 Project Overview
Customer segmentation is a key strategy in data-driven marketing. By clustering customers with similar behaviours, companies can:
- Personalize promotions and offers
- Improve customer retention
- Identify high-value customer groups

In this project, clustering algorithms such as **K-Means**, **Hierarchical Clustering**, and **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)** were used to uncover meaningful patterns from the data.

## 🚀 Key Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Implementation of multiple clustering techniques  
- Comparison of algorithm performance  
- Business insights derived from cluster characteristics
